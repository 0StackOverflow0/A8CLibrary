# A8 C Window Library
Atari 8 Bit Text Mode Windowing Library written in C (CC65).

I originally wrote this in Action! language for the Atari 8 bit starting around 2015.

I ran into some limitations with the Action! version in a project regarding memory space and function paramater size when compiled into a standlone executable.  This prompted the conversion into C.   I considered several C implementations on the Atari 8 bit itself, then settled on CC65 to use modern development tools and target the A8 platform.
